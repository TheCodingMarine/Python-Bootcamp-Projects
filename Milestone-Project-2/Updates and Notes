To do:
    - Create a final "card check" against players to determine winner after player/dealer cycle through loops
    - Implement stats tracker
    - Format a standout printout method to insert into each loop that prints, player/dealer cards, player cash.




16 January 2022:
    - Wrote the last functions. Worked on the logic for the player and dealer's turns. 
    - Played with 'while' loops and if/elif/else statements, found a general structure.

16 January 2022:
    - Logic and looping sorted out. 
    - Game largely finished
    - Final formatting of print to make game more readable on command line and easier to track play.
    
17 January 2022:
    - After player landed soft hand and selected NOT to play the Ace as a 1. The game skipped
      skipped over the function to ask if the player would like to hit and automatically awarded
      a win to the dealer even though the dealer had a lower hand. Investigate.
    - Made formatting changes to printouts in the terminal. Formatted code for better readability.
